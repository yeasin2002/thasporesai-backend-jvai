# Better-T-Stack Project Rules

This is a providus_org project created with Better-T-Stack CLI.

## Project Structure

This is a monorepo with the following structure:


- **`apps/server/`** - Backend server
(Express)


## Available Scripts

- `pnpm run dev` - Start all apps in development mode
- `pnpm run dev:server` - Start only the server

## Database Commands

All database operations should be run from the server workspace:

- `pnpm run db:push` - Push schema changes to database
- `pnpm run db:studio` - Open database studio
- `pnpm run db:generate` - Generate mongoose files
- `pnpm run db:migrate` - Run database migrations

Database models are located in `apps/server/src/db/models/`

```bash
pnpx create-better-t-stack
add
```

Available addons you can add:
- **Documentation**: Starlight, Fumadocs
- **Linting**: Biome, Oxlint, Ultracite

You can also add web deployment configurations like Cloudflare Workers support.

## Project Configuration

This project includes a `bts.jsonc` configuration file that stores your Better-T-Stack settings:

- Contains your selected stack configuration (database, ORM, backend, frontend, etc.)
- Used by the CLI to understand your project structure
- Safe to delete if not needed
- Updated automatically when using the `add` command

## Key Points

- This is a monorepo using pnpm workspaces
- Each app has its own `package.json` and dependencies
- Run commands from the root to execute across all workspaces
- Run workspace-specific commands with `pnpm run command-name`
- Use `pnpx
create-better-t-stack add` to add more features later
